> ## Add registries for your apps as well and send a merge request !
# About
This is a simple script I made to clear those annoying context menu entries that are added when you install a new program without even asking you and appear when you right click on anything...

As I have observed many apps keep reinstalling them after each update...

Which is even more annyong because it doesnt respect my preferences...

This script simply clear them, after installing/updating those programs just run the script and it will clear all extra context menu elements...

# How to RUN
```
1) right click "clear_context_menu.cmd"
2) "Run as Administrator"
```

# FAQ
> Why Administrator ?
- Because most apps install them as administrator and therefore removing them from context also needs Administrator privilages....

<br>

> What if I dont run as administrator ?
- Give it a try and see what can or cannot be removed.
- Sometimes you dont need to run as Administrator at all

<br>

> I dont have all the apps listed in the script installed.
- If the app is not installed on your machine nothing will happen so dont wory.


<br>

> I dont see some of my apps in the script.
- You can always add send send a merge request. You can ask me for more info about how to find them.
